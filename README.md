# home_price_predictions
Predicting Home prices in python using Linear Regression
we will create a linear regression model to predict house prices based on house sizes. Using a scatterplot of test data, the model will form a relationship between the two variables and then makes predictions.
For these we can predict by this libraries:
-Scikit-learn: commonly known as Sklearn, provides a user-friendly interface for all kinds of machine learning.
-Pandas:  lets you to analyze, clean, explore, and manipulate data from different sources.
-NumPy: It offers a robust foundation for numerical operations and data analysis.
-Matplotlib: transforms your data into compelling visuals like 2D graphs and bar charts.
